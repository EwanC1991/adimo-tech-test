### Adimo Tech Test

Here is my attempt at the Adimo Tech Test

To run the projects, enter these commands into the terminal.

Main Task
1. cd main-task
2. npm install
3. npm run start

This will produce a JSON file in the "main-task" folder called "main-task.json" which contains the output of the web scraper.

Challenge 1
1. cd challenge-1
2. npm install
3. npm run start

This will produce a JSON file in the "challenge-1" folder called "challenge-1.json" which contains the output of the web scraper.

Challenge 2
1. cd challenge-2
2. npm install
3. npm run start

This will produce a JSON file in the "challenge-2" folder called "challenge-2.json" which contains the output of the web scraper.
